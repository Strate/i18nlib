/**
 * Create a new phone number formatter object that formats numbers according to the parameters.<p>
 * 
 * The params object can contain zero or more of the following parameters:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>locale</i> locale to use to format this number, or undefined to use the default locale
 * <li><i>style</i> the name of style to use to format numbers, or undefined to use the default style
 * <li><i>mcc</i> the MCC of the country to use if the number is a local number and the country code is not known
 * </ul>
 *
 * Some regions have more than one style of formatting, and the style parameter
 * selects which style the user prefers. The style names can be found by calling <p>
 *
 * If the MCC is given, numbers will be formatted in the manner of the country
 * specified by the MCC. If it is not given, but the locale is, the manner of
 * the country in the locale will be used. If neither the locale or MCC are not given,
 * then the country of the current locale is used.

	 * Format the parts of a phone number appropriately according to the settings in 
	 * this formatter instance.
	 *  
	 * The params can contain zero or more of these properties:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><i>partial</i> boolean which tells whether or not this phone number 
	 * represents a partial number or not. The default is false, which means the number 
	 * represents a whole number. 
	 * <li><i>style</i> style to use to format the number, if different from the 
	 * default style or the style specified in the constructor
	 * </ul>
	 *      
	 * The partial parameter specifies whether or not the phone number contains
	 * a partial phone number or if it is a whole phone number. A partial 
	 * number is usually a number as the user is entering it with a dial pad. The
	 * reason is that certain types of phone numbers should be formatted differently
	 * depending on whether or not it represents a whole number. Specifically, SMS
	 * short codes are formatted differently.<p>
	 * 
	 * Example: a subscriber number of "48773" in the US would get formatted as:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>partial: 487-73  (perhaps the user is in the process of typing a whole phone 
	 * number such as 487-7379)
	 * <li>whole:   48773   (this is the entire SMS short code)
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * Any place in the UI where the user types in phone numbers, such as the keypad in 
	 * the phone app, should pass in partial: true to this formatting routine. All other 
	 * places, such as the call log in the phone app, should pass in partial: false, or 
	 * leave the partial flag out of the parameters entirely. 
	 * 
	 * @param {string|ilib.PhoneNumber} number object containing the phone number to format, or a 
	 * string containing a phone number to parse and then reformat
	 * @param {Object} params Parameters which control how to format the number
	 * @return {string} Returns the formatted phone number as a string.
