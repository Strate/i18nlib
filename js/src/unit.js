/**
 * Create a measurement instance. The measurement is immutable once
 * it is created, but can be converted to other measurements later.<p>
 * 
 * The options may contain any of the following properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>amount</i> - either a numeric amount for this measurement given
 * as a number of the specified units, or another ilib.Measurement instance 
 * to convert to the requested units. If converting to new units, the type
 * of measure between the other instance's units and the current units
 * must be the same. That is, you can only convert one unit of mass to
 * another. You cannot convert a unit of mass into a unit of length. 
 * 
 * <li><i>unit</i> - units of this measurement. Use the 
 * static call {@link ilib.Measurement.getAvailableUnits}
 * to find out what units this version of ilib supports. If the given unit
 * is not a base unit, the amount will be converted to the number of base units.
 * For example, if an instance is constructed with 1 kg, this will be converted
 * automatically into 1000 g, as grams are the base unit and kg is merely a 
 * commonly used scale of grams.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Here is an example of converting a length into new units:
 * 
 * <code>
 * var measurement1 = new ilib.Measurement({
 *   amount: 5,
 *   units: "kilometers"
 * });
 * var measurement2 = new ilib.Measurement({
 *   amount: measurement1,
 *   units: "miles"
 * });
 * </code>
 * 
 * The value in measurement2 will end up being about 3.125 miles.
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @class
 * @param {Object} options options that control the construction of this instance
