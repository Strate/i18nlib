/**
 * Create a new chararcter set info instance. Charset instances give information about
 * a particular character set, such as whether or not it is single byte or multibyte,
 * and which languages commonly use that charset.<p>
 * 
 * The optional options object holds extra parameters if they are necessary. The
 * current list of supported options are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>name</i> - the name of the charset. This can be given as any commonly
 * used name for the character set, which is mapped to a standard name by the
 * static method {@link ilib.Charset.getStandardName}. If a name is not given,
 * this class will return information about the base character set of Javascript,
 * which is currently unicode.
 * 
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when this object is fully 
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to
 * load any missing data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the 
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 * 
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing data synchronously or 
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, because the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the 
 * loader callback function when data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object 
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, 
 * or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call
 * the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done. 
 * If the onLoad option is not given, this class will only attempt to load any
 * missing data synchronously.
 * 
 * Depends directive: !depends charset.js
 * 
 * @class
 * @constructor
 * @see {ilib.setLoaderCallback} for information about registering a loader callback instance
 * @param {Object=} options options which govern the construction of this instance
