	 * has a value or range of values to match followed by a hash character "#"
	 * followed by the string to use if the variable matches the criteria.<p>

	 * 
	 * The strings to format may contain replacement variables that will be formatted
	 * using the format() method above and the params argument as a source of values
	 * to use while formatting those variables.<p>
	 * 
	 * If the criterion for a particular choice is empty, that choice will be used
	 * as the default one for use when none of the other choice's criteria match.<p>
	 * 
	 * Example string:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * var num = 22;
	 * var str = new ilib.String("0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|#There are {number} objects.");
	 * console.log(str.formatChoice(num, {

	 * <pre>
	 * "There are 22 objects."
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * If multiple choice patterns can match a given argument index, the first one 
	 * encountered in the string will be used. If no choice patterns match the 
	 * argument index, then the default choice will be used. If there is no default
	 * choice defined, then this method will return an empty string.<p>
	 * 
	 * <b>Special Syntax</b><p>
	 * 
	 * For any choice format string, all of the patterns in the string should be
	 * of a single type: numeric, boolean, or string/regexp. The type of the 
	 * patterns is determined by the type of the argument index parameter.<p>
	 * 
	 * If the argument index is numeric, then some special syntax can be used 
	 * in the patterns to match numeric ranges.<p>
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><i>&gt;x</i> - match any number that is greater than x 
	 * <li><i>&gt;=x</i> - match any number that is greater than or equal to x
	 * <li><i>&lt;x</i> - match any number that is less than x
	 * <li><i>&lt;=x</i> - match any number that is less than or equal to x
	 * <li><i>start-end</i> - match any number in the range [start,end)
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * If the argument index is a boolean, the values "true" and "false" may appear
	 * as the choice patterns.<p>
	 * 
	 * If the argument index is of type string, then the choice patterns may contain
	 * regular expressions, or static strings as degenerate regexps.
	 * 
	 * @param {*} argIndex The index into the choice array of the current parameter
	 * @param {Object} params The hash of parameter values that replace the replacement 
	 * variables in the string

	/**
	 * Perform the Unicode Normalization Algorithm upon the string and return 
	 * the resulting new string. The current string is not modified.
	 * 
	 * <h2>Forms</h2>
	 * 
	 * The forms of possible normalizations are defined by the <a 
	 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode Standard
	 * Annex (UAX) 15</a>. The form parameter is a string that may have one 
	 * of the following values:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>nfd - Canonical decomposition. This decomposes characters into
	 * their exactly equivalent forms. For example, "&uuml;" would decompose
	 * into a "u" followed by the combining diaeresis character. 
	 * <li>nfc - Canonical decomposition followed by canonical composition.
	 * This decomposes and then recomposes character into their shortest
	 * exactly equivalent forms by recomposing as many combining characters
	 * as possible. For example, "&uuml;" followed by a combining 
	 * macron character would decompose into a "u" followed by the combining 
	 * macron characters the combining diaeresis character, and then be recomposed into
	 * the u with macron and diaeresis "&#x1E7B;" character. The reason that
	 * the "nfc" form decomposes and then recomposes is that combining characters
	 * have a specific order under the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, and
	 * partly composed characters such as the "&uuml;" followed by combining
	 * marks may change the order of the combining marks when decomposed and
	 * recomposed.
	 * <li>nfkd - Compatibility decomposition. This decomposes characters
	 * into compatible forms that may not be exactly equivalent semantically,
	 * as well as performing canonical decomposition as well.
	 * For example, the "&oelig;" ligature character decomposes to the two
	 * characters "oe" because they are compatible even though they are not 
	 * exactly the same semantically. 
	 * <li>nfkc - Compatibility decomposition followed by canonical composition.
	 * This decomposes characters into compatible forms, then recomposes
	 * characters using the canonical composition. That is, it breaks down
	 * characters into the compatible forms, and then recombines all combining
	 * marks it can with their base characters. For example, the character
	 * "&#x01FD;" would be normalized to "a&eacute;" by first decomposing
	 * the character into "a" followed by "e" followed by the combining acute accent
	 * combining mark, and then recomposed to an "a" followed by the "e"
	 * with acute accent.
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * <h2>Operation</h2>
	 * 
	 * Two strings a and b can be said to be canonically equivalent if 
	 * normalize(a) = normalize(b)
	 * under the nfc normalization form. Two strings can be said to be compatible if
	 * normalize(a) = normalize(b) under the nfkc normalization form.<p>
	 * 
	 * The canonical normalization is often used to see if strings are 
	 * equivalent to each other, and thus is useful when implementing parsing 
	 * algorithms or exact matching algorithms. It can also be used to ensure
	 * that any string output produces a predictable sequence of characters.<p>
	 * 
	 * Compatibility normalization 
	 * does not always preserve the semantic meaning of all the characters, 
	 * although this is sometimes the behaviour that you are after. It is useful, 
	 * for example, when doing searches of user-input against text in documents 
	 * where the matches are supposed to "fuzzy". In this case, both the query
	 * string and the document string would be mapped to their compatibility 
	 * normalized forms, and then compared.<p>
	 * 
	 * Compatibility normalization also does not guarantee round-trip conversion
	 * to and from legacy character sets as the normalization is "lossy". It is 
	 * akin to doing a lower- or upper-case conversion on text -- after casing,
	 * you cannot tell what case each character is in the original string. It is 
	 * good for matching and searching, but it rarely good for output because some 
	 * distinctions or meanings in the original text have been lost.<p>
	 * 
	 * Note that W3C normalization for HTML also escapes and unescapes
	 * HTML character entities such as "&amp;uuml;" for u with diaeresis. This
	 * method does not do such escaping or unescaping. If normalization is required
	 * for HTML strings with entities, unescaping should be performed on the string 
	 * prior to calling this method.<p>
	 * 
	 * <h2>Data</h2>
	 * 
	 * Normalization requires a fair amount of mapping data, much of which you may 
	 * not need for the characters expected in your texts. It is possible to assemble
	 * a copy of ilib that saves space by only including normalization data for 
	 * those scripts that you expect to encounter in your data.<p>
	 * 
	 * The normalization data is organized by normalization form and within there
	 * by script. To include the normalization data for a particular script with
	 * a particular normalization form, use the directive:
	 * 
	 * <pre><code>
	 * !depends &lt;form&gt;/&lt;script&gt;.js
	 * </code></pre>
	 * 
	 * Where &lt;form&gt is the normalization form ("nfd", "nfc", "nfkd", or "nfkc"), and
	 * &lt;script&gt; is the ISO 15924 code for the script you would like to
	 * support. Example: to load in the NFC data for Cyrillic, you would use:
	 * 
	 * <pre><code>
	 * !depends nfc/Cyrl.js
	 * </code></pre>
	 * 
	 * Note that because certain normalization forms include others in their algorithm, 
	 * their data also depends on the data for the other forms. For example, if you 
	 * include the "nfc" data for a script, you will automatically get the "nfd" data 
	 * for that same script as well because the NFC algorithm does NFD normalization 
	 * first. Here are the dependencies:<p>
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>NFD -> no dependencies
	 * <li>NFC -> NFD
	 * <li>NFKD -> NFD
	 * <li>NFKC -> NFKD, NFD, NFC
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * A special value for the script dependency is "all" which will cause the data for 
	 * all scripts
	 * to be loaded for that normalization form. This would be useful if you know that
	 * you are going to normalize a lot of multilingual text or cannot predict which scripts
	 * will appear in the input. Because the NFKC form depends on all others, you can 
	 * get all of the data for all forms automatically by depending on "nfkc/all.js".
	 * Note that the normalization data for practically all script automatically depend
	 * on data for the Common script (code "Zyyy") which contains all of the characters
	 * that are commonly used in many different scripts. Examples of characters in the
	 * Common script are the ASCII punctuation characters, or the ASCII Arabic 
	 * numerals "0" through "9".<p>
	 * 
	 * By default, none of the data for normalization is automatically 
	 * included in the preassembled iliball.js file. 
	 * If you would like to normalize strings, you must assemble
	 * your own copy of ilib and explicitly include the normalization data
	 * for those scripts as per the instructions above. This normalization method will
