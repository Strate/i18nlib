 * <li><i>unixtime<i> - sets the time of this instance according to the given 
 * unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970.
 * 
 * <li><i>julianday</i> - sets the time of this instance according to the given
 * Julian Day instance or the Julian Day given as a float
 * 
 * <li><i>year</i> - any integer, including 0
 * 
 * <li><i>month</i> - 1 to 12, where 1 means January, 2 means February, etc.
 * 
 * <li><i>day</i> - 1 to 31
 * 
 * <li><i>hour</i> - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation 
 * is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation

 * 
 * <li><i>second</i> - 0 to 59
 * 
 * <li><i>millisecond</i> - 0 to 999
 * 
 * <li><i>date</i> - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one.
