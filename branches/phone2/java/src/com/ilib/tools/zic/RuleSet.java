/**
 * RuleSet - models a set of rules that document when to start and stop observing
 * daylight savings time across a number of time frames. 
 * 
 * Rules often come in pairs to
 * tell how to start and end daylight savings time within a particular year, and only
 * one pair of rules should be valid for any particular time frame. One 
 * particular pair of rules will be considered the current rule that is in effect for
 * the zone. The current rules stay in effect until the 
 * government overseeing the time zone decides to change the rules.
