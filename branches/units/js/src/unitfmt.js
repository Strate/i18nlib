/**
 * Create a new unit formatter instance. The unit formatter is immutable once
 * it is created, but can format as many different strings with different values
 * as needed with the same options. Create different unit formatter instances 
 * for different purposes and then keep them cached for use later if you have 
 * more than one unit string to format.<p>
 * 
 * The options may contain any of the following properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>locale</i> - locale to use when formatting the units. The locale also
 * controls the translation of the names of the units. If the locale is
 * not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used.
 * 
 * <li><i>autoScale</i> - when true, automatically scale the amount to get the smallest
 * number greater than 1, where possible, possibly by converting units within the locale's
 * measurement system. For example, if the current locale is "en-US", and we have
 * a measurement containing 278 fluid ounces, then the number "278" can be scaled down
 * by converting the units to a larger one such as gallons. The scaled size would be
 * 2.17188 gallons. Since iLib does not have a US customary measure larger than gallons,
 * it cannot scale it down any further. If the amount is less than the smallest measure
 * already, it cannot be scaled down any further and no autoscaling will be applied.
 * Default for the autoScale property is "true", so it only needs to be specified when
 * you want to turn off autoscaling.
 * 
 * <li><i>autoConvert</i> - automatically convert the units to the nearest appropriate
 * measure of the same type in the measurement system used by the locale. For example, 
 * if a measurement of length is given in meters, but the current locale is "en-US" 
 * which uses the US Customary system, then the nearest appropriate measure would be 
 * "yards", and the amount would be converted from meters to yards automatically before
 * being formatted. Default for the autoConvert property is "true", so it only needs to 
 * be specified when you want to turn off autoconversion.
 *  
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the date format object is fully 
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the UnitFmt object will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the 
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 * 
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or 
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *  
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the 
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object 
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Here is an example of how you might use the unit formatter to format a string with
 * the correct units.<p>
 * 
 * Depends directive: !depends unitfmt.js
 * 
 * @class
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} options options governing the way this date formatter instance works
